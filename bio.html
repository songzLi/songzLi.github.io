<p> Dr. Songze Li joins Hong Kong University of Science and Technology as an assistant professor in 2020. Before that, Dr. Li worked as a researcher at Stanford University on designing, analyzing, and implementing efficient and scalable blockchain consensus protocols. Prior to that, Dr. Li spent a year as a research scientist with Applied Protocol Research, where he worked on scalable sharding solutions for blockchains and efficient verification of data availability in blockchain systems. Dr. Li received his Ph.D. degree from University of Southern California in 2018, and his B.Sc. degree from New York University in 2011, both in electrical engineering. </p>

<p> Dr. Liâ€™s research interests lie on the intersection of theory and system of designing efficient, scalable, and secure distributed computing solutions for machine learning and blockchains. Among his major contributions, he first introduced leveraging techniques from information/coding theory to design distributed computing algorithms, which opened up a new research direction of designing codes for speeding up computations. Dr. Li received USC Viterbi School of Engineering Doctoral Fellowship in 2011. He is among Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship Finalists in 2017. </p>
